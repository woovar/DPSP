<p><strong>Root Cookie</strong> is a simple plugin that changes the paths associated with your WordPress cookies.</p>
<p>
By default the WordPress cookies are matched to your blog url such as www.example.com/blog which means that the cookies cannot accessed by scripts within www.example.com/gallery or even www.example.com.
</p>
<p>
Root cookie will work without any configuration, simply activate the plugin, clear your cookie cache and re-log in.

<strong>Sub Domain Support</strong> <br />
Optionally you can enable subdomain support, this will allow WordPress cookies to be available to test.example.com or something.example.com. Simply tick the tickbox "<em>Allow Cookies to go across All Subdomains</em>" and you are done. <br />
<em>Sometimes</em> the tickbox gets the subdomain wrong, in this case, un-tick the checkbox and fill in the domain name and click "<em>Update Options</em>"
